# Purpose: Athlete-centric rationale that legitimizes methodology choice
# Variations: 5 per tier (20 total)

STORY_JUSTIFICATIONS = {
    "ayahuasca": [
        # Variation 1: The math problem
        """You have 4 hours and a dream. The math doesn't work—you know that. But you're showing up anyway. So instead of pretending those 4 hours can magically become 12, this plan makes every single one of them count. Quality over quantity isn't a compromise here. It's the only strategy that works.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The efficiency angle
        """Most plans for Unbound are written for people with 12+ hours a week. This one isn't. Cramming high-volume training into a low-volume week doesn't make you faster—it makes you tired. The workouts here are designed for maximum adaptation with minimum time. Every session has a purpose. None of them assume you have hours to waste.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The recognition angle
        """This plan is for people making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The methodology defense
        """Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        """This plan isn't designed to get you on a podium. It's designed to get you across the line feeling like you raced, not survived. That requires a specific training approach: sessions short enough to recover from, intense enough to create change, and focused enough to build the skills Unbound actually demands. Most plans ignore this because they're template workouts scaled down. This one was built from scratch for your constraints.""",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        """This plan is for people 50+ with limited hours. Recovery isn't optional anymore. Your body needs longer adaptation windows. This plan maximizes efficiency while respecting that reality. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. The difference between finishing and breaking at your age isn't more volume—it's smarter recovery. Every session counts because recovery takes longer.""",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        """You're 45+ making this work around a life. Your body needs longer recovery windows. This plan respects that. Every session is essential. Every rest day is strategic. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training decisions. The plan builds you up without breaking you down. Recovery becomes the primary training variable, not an afterthought."""
    ],
    
    "finisher": [
        # Variation 1: The leveling up moment
        """This plan is for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The structure revelation
        """Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. It's for people who want their fitness to show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. The result is performance that arrives when you need it—not when luck decides.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The capacity building angle
        """Finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—but in the right order and the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering. Everything here is calibrated to create race-day capacity, not training-day heroics.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The specificity defense
        """Here's what separates this from generic century plans: it's designed for gravel racing, not road endurance. That means technical skills (Section 7), fueling protocols that work on rough terrain (Section 8), and power distribution strategies for variable-pace events (Section 10). You're not just getting fitter—you're getting faster at the specific thing Unbound demands.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The consistency angle
        """You've tried coaching yourself. You know it's hard to maintain consistency. The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.""",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        """This plan is for people 45+ who know recovery isn't optional anymore. Your body needs longer adaptation windows. Your training needs to respect that. This plan uses moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. The difference between thriving and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training more deliberately. Recovery becomes the primary training variable, not an afterthought.""",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        """You're 50+ and your recovery needs are different. Training at 8-12 hours requires different protocols than it did at 30. This plan acknowledges that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are respected. Every session counts because recovery takes longer. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training. The plan builds you up without breaking you down.""",
        
        # Variation 8: G Spot and Three-Act
        """Most training plans use generic Sweet Spot protocols. This plan uses G Spot training (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race pace that's sustainable for 10+ hours. The Three-Act pacing structure gives you a tactical framework, not vague advice to 'start conservatively.' Mental skills like 6-2-7 breathing are practiced weekly until automatic. Everything is built for gravel's variable-pace demands, not road racing.""",
        
        # Variation 9: Systems integration
        """Generic plans ignore mental training and technical skills. This plan integrates both systematically. You'll practice 6-2-7 breathing under stress, rehearse Three-Act pacing decisions, and drill cornering and descending weekly. The dress rehearsal ride validates everything—nutrition, pacing, equipment, mental protocols—before race day. No surprises.""",
        
        # Variation 10: G Spot specificity
        """This plan uses G Spot training (88-92% FTP) instead of generic Sweet Spot. That's gravel-specific race pace—sustainable for 10+ hours, not just 2-3 hour road efforts. Combined with Three-Act pacing structure and practiced mental skills, you're building systems that work for Unbound's variable-pace demands. Everything is tested before race day."""
    ],
    
    "compete": [
        # Variation 1: The performance gap
        """Your fitness isn't showing up in results. You're training 12-18 hours. You're doing the work. But something's not translating to race day. Usually it's one of three things: wrong intensity distribution, poor pacing strategy, or mismatched taper protocol. This plan addresses all three. The training is structured to create race-specific performance, not just training-day power.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        """Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. This plan fixes that. Every session has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting. This plan gives you the structure serious amateurs need without the guesswork most training programs leave behind.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The plateau breaker
        """You've been stuck. Same training, same results, can't figure out why the next level won't arrive. The answer is usually simple: your training stopped challenging your current fitness. This plan uses progressive overload correctly—not just adding volume, but strategically increasing demands where they create adaptation. You'll work harder than before, but smarter than ever.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The race execution angle
        """Here's what this plan does differently: it teaches you to execute races, not just finish trained. Pacing strategy (Section 10), fueling under fatigue (Section 8), mental protocols when it hurts (Section 9). Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The methodology defense
        """This plan uses polarized training principles because they work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability (12-18 hours), enough intensity to sharpen performance (Zone 4-5 sessions), and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target on a specific date.""",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        """This plan is for people 45+ who are still competitive but know their bodies need different recovery protocols. Training at 12-18 hours requires age-appropriate recovery architecture. This plan respects that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are compressed (2-3 week cycles instead of 4). The difference between competing and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training with smarter recovery. Every session has purpose because recovery takes longer.""",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        """You're 50+ and your adaptation timeline is different. Your body adapts slower. Your recovery needs are longer. This plan respects that reality. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs smarter training. The plan uses compressed periodization (2-3 week builds) and recovery-first architecture. You'll train hard, but recovery becomes the primary variable.""",
        
        # Variation 8: The systematic progression
        """This plan eliminates the guesswork that plagues high-volume training. Every week has a specific purpose. Every session targets a measurable adaptation. Base builds durability. Build adds power. Peak sharpens performance. The progression is systematic, not accidental. You'll know exactly why you're doing each workout and how it contributes to race-day performance. That clarity creates confidence.""",
        
        # Variation 9: The execution focus
        """Most training plans build fitness. This one builds race execution. The workouts create the engine. The protocols teach you to drive it. Pacing strategies for variable terrain. Fueling under fatigue. Mental protocols when it hurts. Technical skills for rough conditions. Everything here prepares you to execute on race day, not just show up fit. That's what separates competitors from finishers.""",
        
        # Variation 10: GOAT Method systems
        """High-volume training without systems breaks athletes. This plan uses GOAT Method training: G Spot progression, HRV-guided recovery, Three-Act tactical framework. You're not just accumulating hours—you're building specific capacities. Mental skills are practiced under load. Technical skills are drilled weekly. Recovery is monitored objectively. Training at 12-18 hours requires precision, not just discipline."""

        # Variation 1: The coaching moment
        """You've been your own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But you also know that self-coaching has blind spots—especially when it comes to recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more. Sometimes the best coach tells you to back off.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        """Most plans at this volume just add more work. This one adds more precision. At 18+ hours a week, training quality determines results—not quantity. Every session here has a specific purpose. Every recovery day is strategic. The difference between podium and pack isn't who trains hardest—it's who trains most intelligently over 12 weeks without breaking.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The competitive edge
        """Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The methodology defense
        """Here's why this plan works at elite volume: it balances polarized intensity with race-specific demands. You need sustainable power (Zone 2 base), repeatable efforts (threshold work), and explosive capacity (VO2max sessions). Most high-volume plans just pile on endurance. This one builds a complete athlete. That's what Unbound rewards—not just who can suffer longest, but who can attack when it matters.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        """This plan isn't for people hoping to podium. It's for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no "close enough" on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you. At this level, coaching provides the roadmap. You still have to drive. But if you're serious about results, this gets you there.""",
        
        # Variation 6: GOAT Method elite
        """Elite gravel racing rewards proprietary systems. GOAT Method training: G Spot mastery at 88-92% FTP, Three-Act execution practiced until automatic, HRV-guided progression for optimal recovery timing. You'll practice descending and cornering at race pace. Mental protocols like 6-2-7 breathing become reflexive under suffering. The difference between podium and pack is often details—this plan delivers them."""
