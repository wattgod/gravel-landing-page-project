STORY_JUSTIFICATIONS = {
    "ayahuasca": [
        # Variation 1: The math problem
        """I built this for people who have 4 hours and a dream. The math doesn't work—you know that, I know that. But I also know you're showing up anyway. So instead of pretending those 4 hours can magically become 12, I built a plan that makes every single one of them count. Quality over quantity isn't a compromise here. It's the only strategy that works.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The efficiency angle
        """Most plans for Unbound are written for people with 12+ hours a week. This one isn't. I built this because cramming high-volume training into a low-volume week doesn't make you faster—it makes you tired. The workouts here are designed for maximum adaptation with minimum time. Every session has a purpose. None of them assume you have hours to waste.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The recognition angle
        """I built this plan for people who are making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The methodology defense
        """Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        """I didn't build this plan to get you on a podium. I built it to get you across the line feeling like you raced, not survived. That requires a specific training approach: sessions short enough to recover from, intense enough to create change, and focused enough to build the skills Unbound actually demands. Most plans ignore this because they're template workouts scaled down. This one was built from scratch for your constraints."""
    ],
    
    "finisher": [
        # Variation 1: The leveling up moment
        """I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The structure revelation
        """Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. I built it for people who want their fitness to show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. The result is performance that arrives when you need it—not when luck decides.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The capacity building angle
        """I built this because finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—but in the right order and the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering. Everything here is calibrated to create race-day capacity, not training-day heroics.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The specificity defense
        """Here's what separates this from generic century plans: it's designed for gravel racing, not road endurance. That means technical skills (Section 7), fueling protocols that work on rough terrain (Section 8), and power distribution strategies for variable-pace events (Section 10). You're not just getting fitter—you're getting faster at the specific thing Unbound demands.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The consistency angle
        """I built this plan for people who've tried coaching themselves and know it's hard to maintain consistency. The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance."""
    ],
    
    "compete": [
        # Variation 1: The performance gap
        """I built this for people whose fitness isn't showing up in results. You're training 12-18 hours. You're doing the work. But something's not translating to race day. Usually it's one of three things: wrong intensity distribution, poor pacing strategy, or mismatched taper protocol. This plan addresses all three. The training is structured to create race-specific performance, not just training-day power.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        """Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. I built this plan to fix that. Every session has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting. This plan gives you the structure serious amateurs need without the guesswork most training programs leave behind.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The plateau breaker
        """I built this because you've been stuck. Same training, same results, can't figure out why the next level won't arrive. The answer is usually simple: your training stopped challenging your current fitness. This plan uses progressive overload correctly—not just adding volume, but strategically increasing demands where they create adaptation. You'll work harder than before, but smarter than ever.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The race execution angle
        """Here's what this plan does differently: it teaches you to execute races, not just finish trained. Pacing strategy (Section 10), fueling under fatigue (Section 8), mental protocols when it hurts (Section 9). Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The methodology defense
        """I built this using polarized training principles because they work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability (12-18 hours), enough intensity to sharpen performance (Zone 4-5 sessions), and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target on a specific date."""
    ],
    
    "podium": [
        # Variation 1: The coaching moment
        """I built this for people who've been their own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But you also know that self-coaching has blind spots—especially when it comes to recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more. Sometimes the best coach tells you to back off.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        """Most plans at this volume just add more work. I built this one to add more precision. At 18+ hours a week, training quality determines results—not quantity. Every session here has a specific purpose. Every recovery day is strategic. The difference between podium and pack isn't who trains hardest—it's who trains most intelligently over 12 weeks without breaking.""",
        
        # Variation 3: The competitive edge
        """I built this because Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.""",
        
        # Variation 4: The methodology defense
        """Here's why this plan works at elite volume: it balances polarized intensity with race-specific demands. You need sustainable power (Zone 2 base), repeatable efforts (threshold work), and explosive capacity (VO2max sessions). Most high-volume plans just pile on endurance. This one builds a complete athlete. That's what Unbound rewards—not just who can suffer longest, but who can attack when it matters.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        """I didn't build this for people hoping to podium. I built it for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no "close enough" on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you. At this level, coaching provides the roadmap. You still have to drive. But if you're serious about results, this gets you there."""
