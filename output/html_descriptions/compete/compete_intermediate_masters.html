<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You're 50+. Your body adapts slower. Your recovery needs are different. This plan respects that reality. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs smarter training. The difference between thriving and breaking isn't less work—it's better recovery architecture.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">This plan is for people 45+ who are still competitive but know their bodies need different recovery protocols. Training at 12-18 hours requires age-appropriate recovery architecture. This plan respects that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are compressed (2-3 week cycles instead of 4). The difference between competing and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training with smarter recovery. Every session has purpose because recovery takes longer.</p>
