<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You're 45. Recovery isn't optional anymore. This plan builds you up without breaking you down. The difference between finishing and competing at your age isn't more volume—it's smarter recovery. Every session respects your adaptation timeline. Every rest day is strategic. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">This plan is for people 45+ who know recovery isn't optional anymore. Your body needs longer adaptation windows. Your training needs to respect that.

The difference between thriving and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training more deliberately. Recovery becomes the primary training variable, not an afterthought.</p>
