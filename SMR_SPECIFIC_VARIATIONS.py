# SAVE MY RACE SPECIFIC VARIATIONS
# Purpose: Salvage/urgency positioning for 6-week emergency plans
# User instruction: "Even if life got in the way and you haven't been training 
# (or you've been lazy), you'd be surprised how much your body can improve in 
# six weeks. Don't defer your entry, cram some training and make it happen."
#
# KEY POSITIONING:
# - Salvage/urgency, not performance/progression
# - 6 weeks mentioned prominently
# - Triage approach: what matters most, what you can skip
# - Minimum viable fitness, not optimal
# - Life got in the way, don't defer

    # Variation 1: Salvage/urgency
    "Six weeks before {race_name} isn't ideal preparation time. But it's salvageable. Life got in the way—training didn't happen. Don't defer your entry. You'd be surprised how much your body can improve in six weeks if you focus on what actually matters.",
    
    # Variation 2: Life got in the way
    "Even if life got in the way and you haven't been training (or you've been lazy), you'd be surprised how much your body can improve in six weeks. Don't defer your entry. Cram some training and make it happen. This plan shows you how.",
    
    # Variation 3: Emergency salvage
    "Six weeks. That's what you've got. Life got in the way. Training didn't happen. But you're not deferring. This plan is for people who refuse to wait another year. You'd be surprised how much you can build in six weeks if you focus on what actually matters.",
    
    # Variation 4: Don't defer
    "You're six weeks out and behind on training. Don't defer your entry. Don't wait for perfect preparation that never comes. Life will get in the way again. This plan builds minimum viable fitness to finish—not optimal, but sufficient.",
    
    # Variation 5: Cram and make it happen
    "Six weeks before {race_name}. You haven't been training. Life got in the way. But you're showing up anyway. This plan is for people who refuse to defer. Cram the training. Make it happen. You'd be surprised what six weeks of focused work can do.",
