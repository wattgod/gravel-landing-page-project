  <name>W11 Sat - Moderate Ride with Touches</name>
  <description>• Duration: 60-75 min • STRUCTURE: 30 min easy → 2x8 min @ "moderately hard" / 4 min easy → Final 20 min easy • Final "reminder" workout. Should feel strong. Check bike final time. • CADENCE WORK: Mix cadences on efforts.

• MID SOUTH - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• MID SOUTH - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• MID SOUTH - ROBUST TAPER:
Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume is low, but maintain sharpness. For competitive athletes, freshness is everything for a 100-mile day.</description>
