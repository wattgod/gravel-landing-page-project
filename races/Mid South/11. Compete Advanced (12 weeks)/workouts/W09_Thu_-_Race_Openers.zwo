  <name>W09 Thu - Race Openers</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 20 min warmup → 4x4 min @ 105-110% FTP (4 min easy between) → 4x1 min @ 120% FTP (3 min easy between) → 15 min cooldown • Race openers. Short, sharp efforts to keep top-end power sharp. Should feel snappy, explosive, powerful. • CADENCE WORK: High cadence (100+ rpm) on all efforts.

• MID SOUTH - WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. For Mid South, prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• MID SOUTH - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• MID SOUTH - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
