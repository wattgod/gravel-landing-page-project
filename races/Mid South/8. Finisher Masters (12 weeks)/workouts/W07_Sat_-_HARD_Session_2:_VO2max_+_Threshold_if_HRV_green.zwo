  <name>W07 Sat - HARD Session #2: VO2max + Threshold (if HRV green)</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min warmup → 5x3 min @ 110-115% FTP (3 min easy) → 15 min easy → 2x12 min @ 100-105% FTP (6 min easy) → 10 min cooldown • Readiness Check: Green + slept well? Full workout. Yellow? 4x3 min VO2 + 2x10 min threshold. Red? 60 min easy. Big quality day. VO2 efforts then threshold. Break down mentally—one interval at a time. • LOADED INTERVALS: For threshold blocks, try loaded pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 11 min Z3 (self-selected cadence). This simulates race starts. • CADENCE WORK: VO2 intervals—alternate high and low cadence. Threshold blocks—use loaded pattern or rhythm pattern.

• MID SOUTH - WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. For Mid South, prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• MID SOUTH - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• MID SOUTH - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
