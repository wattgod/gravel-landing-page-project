  <name>W11 Tue - Light Race Pace (if HRV green)</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min easy → 3x6 min @ 85-90% FTP (3 min easy between) → 10 min easy • Readiness Check: Green? Do workout. Yellow? 3x4 min @ 85%. Red? Skip, ride 30 min easy. Reduced volume, maintained intensity. Should feel controlled and strong. • CADENCE WORK: High cadence on all efforts (100+ rpm).

• MID SOUTH - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• MID SOUTH - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• MID SOUTH - ROBUST TAPER:
Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume is low, but maintain sharpness. For competitive athletes, freshness is everything for a 100-mile day.</description>
