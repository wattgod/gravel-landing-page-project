  <name>W12 Sun - Race Day or Recovery</name>
  <description>• If racing Sunday: RACE DAY—EXECUTE YOUR PLAN • If raced Saturday: Easy 30-45 min recovery spin, celebrate your achievement • Race Day Notes: You've prepared with focused, efficient training. Every session counted. Now execute: conservative start, steady build, strong finish. When it hurts, remember—this is why you trained. You're ready.

• MID SOUTH - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• MID SOUTH - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• MID SOUTH - ROBUST TAPER:
Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume is low, but maintain sharpness. For competitive athletes, freshness is everything for a 100-mile day.</description>
