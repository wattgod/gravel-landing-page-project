# From pre-built libraries in skill
COMPARISON_HOOK = "Two versions of Unbound 200: managing chaos at mile 100 — or executing a plan you've run 50 times."

PAIN_STAT = "200 miles. 11,000 feet. 95°F June heat. 40% don't finish."

# From research - solution-state language
SOLUTION_STATE_LANGUAGE = "You had fitness but not fueling. Went too hard because everyone did. By mile 80, nothing sounded good but you needed 200 more calories."

STORY_JUSTIFICATION = "Training for 200 miles without a plan is like an exam without studying. Wing it. Or know you're ready."

# Race-specific features (from training plan structure)
RACE_SPECIFIC_1 = "Heat protocol weeks 6-10 so 95° feels manageable"
RACE_SPECIFIC_2 = "6-hour dress rehearsal week 9 — run this before race day"
RACE_SPECIFIC_3 = "Power pacing for Flint Hills rollers"

# This will be customized per plan based on weeks
FUNCTIONALLY_FREE_POSITIONING_12 = "12 weeks. $150 entry. $500 travel. You're spending that with or without a plan. Ready, or guessing?"
FUNCTIONALLY_FREE_POSITIONING_6 = "6 weeks. $150 entry. $500 travel. You're spending that with or without a plan. Ready, or guessing?"
