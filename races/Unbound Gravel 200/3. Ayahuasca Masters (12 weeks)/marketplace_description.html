# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.

Most time-crunched riders try to cram high-volume training into low-volume weeks. It doesn't work. This plan uses high-intensity intervals and efficient structure to maximize adaptation from minimal time. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Outdoor options for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution. Taper protocol designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks. Race-pace power targets calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts. Dress rehearsal rides at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems. Fueling protocols tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress.

**Your training guide delivers**: Training Fundamentals  — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them. FAQ  — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions. Workout Execution  — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes. Training Zones  — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required.

**The alternative?** Without a plan, you wing it. Ride when you can. Go hard sometimes. Rest when life forces you to. That's not training. That's hoping for the best.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 0-5 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
