<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">I built this plan for people who are making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">Without structured training, those 4 hours turn into riding around. No progression. No intensity. No race-specific prep. You arrive at Unbound with fitness you could've built on a commute.</p>
