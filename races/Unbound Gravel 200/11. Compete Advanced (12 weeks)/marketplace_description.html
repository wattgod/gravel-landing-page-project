# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Polarized training principles work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability, enough intensity to sharpen performance, and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target.

You're training 12-18 hours but results aren't translating. Most riders at this volume train too much in the middle—not hard enough, not easy enough. This plan uses polarized training: 80% easy, 20% hard. The structure is systematic. The progression is clear. Race fitness arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** G Spot work (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot. 9-hour dress rehearsal validating everything from nutrition to power distribution at race intensity. Mental training system for suffering management and tactical decision-making. Precision taper protocol with deload timing proven for competitive athletes. VO2max intervals that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering.

**Your training guide delivers**: Fueling & Hydration  — Race-pace fueling protocols that work under fatigue. Race Tactics  — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing. Race-Specific Preparation  — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices. Workout Execution  — How to nail VO2max, threshold, and G Spot (88-92% FTP) sessions.

**The alternative?** Most people at your volume plateau: same training, same results, year after year. They never break through because they never change the stimulus.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 12-18 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
