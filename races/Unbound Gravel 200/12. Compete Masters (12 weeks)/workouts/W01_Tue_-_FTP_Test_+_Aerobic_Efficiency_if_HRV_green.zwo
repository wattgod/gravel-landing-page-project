  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test + Aerobic Efficiency (if HRV green)</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE:
20 min warmup → 5 min all-out → 10 min recovery → 20 min max effort → 15 min easy → 30 min @ 70% FTP (monitor HR drift) → 10 min cooldown

• HRV Check: Green? Do full test. Yellow? Do FTP only, skip durability. Red? Ride 60 min easy, test next week. FTP test = sustained 20 min (not all-out sprint). Masters athletes: multiply by 0.93 (more conservative). Durability check: if HR drifts &gt;5% during 30-min block, aerobic base needs work.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&gt;90 min low intensity: 60g carbs/hr. 1-1.5 bottles/hr. 600-1200 mg sodium/hr depending on heat. Monitor sweat rate—if losing &gt;1-1.5% bodyweight, increase sodium.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 110-minute rides, aim for 1 position change.</description>
