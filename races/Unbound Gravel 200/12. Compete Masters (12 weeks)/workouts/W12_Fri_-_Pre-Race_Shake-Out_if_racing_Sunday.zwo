  <name>W12 Fri - Pre-Race Shake-Out (if racing Sunday)</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE:
15 min easy → 3x3 min @ race pace (2 min easy between) → 3x1 min @ 110% FTP (2 min easy between) → 3x30sec @ 115% FTP (90sec easy between) → 10 min easy

• Final ride before race. Legs should feel fresh and powerful. Check bike one last time. Test race-day tire pressure. Visualize Masters performance execution—conservative start, strong middle, whatever's left at the end. You're ready.

• CADENCE WORK: High cadence on all efforts (100+ rpm).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT TRAINING (Better Than Nothing):
Protocol: Finish any normal ride, then shower hot (as hot as tolerated) for 10-12 minutes. Keep HR elevated minimally. Hydrate lightly after (don't chug immediately; small sips).

Effect: Maintains heat adaptations, mild plasma-volume expansion, minimal additional stress.

Use When: Fatigued, limited time, or already did the hard workout of the week.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - ROBUST TAPER:
Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume is low, but maintain sharpness. For competitive athletes, freshness is everything for a 200-mile day.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - GRAVEL GRIT:
Mental preparation is as important as physical. When mile 150 hits and everything hurts, mental toughness gets you through. Visualize success. Break the race into manageable chunks. You've trained for this. You're ready.</description>
