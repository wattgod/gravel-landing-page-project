# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

You're training 12-18 hours. You're doing the work. But something's not translating to race day. This plan fixes that—not through more volume, but through better distribution. The difference between training and racing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

You're training 12-18 hours but results aren't translating. Most riders at this volume train too much in the middle—not hard enough, not easy enough. This plan uses polarized training: 80% easy, 20% hard. The structure is systematic. The progression is clear. Race fitness arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** VO2max intervals that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering. Mental training system for suffering management and tactical decision-making. Recovery architecture designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb. Precision taper protocol with deload timing proven for competitive athletes. G Spot work (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot.

**Your training guide delivers**: Training Fundamentals — Periodization principles that create predictable performance. Fueling & Hydration — Race-pace fueling protocols that work under fatigue. Mental Training — Tactical decision-making and suffering management systems. Race Tactics — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing.

**The alternative?** The alternative is doing what you've always done: same training, same results, same frustration. You know something's wrong. You just don't know what.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 12-18 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
