<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You're 45+. Training at 12-18 hours requires different recovery protocols than it did at 30. This plan acknowledges that.

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">I built this for people 45+ who are still competitive but know their bodies need different recovery protocols. Training at 12-18 hours requires age-appropriate recovery architecture. This plan respects that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are compressed (2-3 week cycles instead of 4). The difference between competing and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training with smarter recovery. Every session has purpose because recovery takes longer.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">Injury prevention protocols—training load matched to recovery capacity, strategic rest that prevents breakdown. Recovery architecture designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb. Recovery-first training architecture—longer rest between hard sessions, HRV-based autoregulation for 45+ athletes.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">Or you could keep training like you're 30 when you're 50+. Ignore longer recovery needs. Push through fatigue. Break down instead of competing.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:14px;font-weight:700">Age changes recovery needs. Moderate volume with emphasis on recovery prevents breakdown while maintaining performance.</p>
