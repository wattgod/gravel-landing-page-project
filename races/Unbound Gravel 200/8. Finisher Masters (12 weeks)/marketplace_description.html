<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You're 50+. Your body needs longer recovery windows. Your training needs to respect that. This plan uses moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. The difference between thriving and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training more deliberately. Recovery becomes the primary training variable.</p>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">I built this because you're 50+ and your recovery needs are different. Training at 8-12 hours requires different protocols than it did at 30. This plan acknowledges that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are respected. Every session counts because recovery takes longer. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training. The plan builds you up without breaking you down.</p>

<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">Or you could keep ignoring that recovery takes longer at 45+. Train like age doesn't matter. Wonder why you're always tired or injured.</p>
