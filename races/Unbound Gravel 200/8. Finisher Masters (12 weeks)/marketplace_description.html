# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

Finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—in the right order, in the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Progressive overload system with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly. Structured taper in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form. Race-specific power zones calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available. Pacing strategy guide for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong. Dress rehearsal ride at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices.

**Your training guide delivers**: Training Zones  — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression. Race Tactics  — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong. Race-Specific Preparation  — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains. Race Week Protocol  — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form.

**The alternative?** Without structure, you accumulate fatigue without accumulating fitness. Tired all the time. Never sharp. Performance stays flat while effort stays high.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 8-12 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
