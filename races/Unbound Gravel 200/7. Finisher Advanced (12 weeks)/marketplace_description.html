# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan unlocks it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Dress rehearsal ride at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices. Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure. Race-specific power zones calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available. Pacing strategy guide for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong. Polarized training distribution that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles.

**Your training guide delivers**: Technical Skills — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash. Race Week Protocol — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form. Your 12-Week Arc — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day. Training Fundamentals — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed.

**The alternative?** Most people train just enough to survive the distance. They don't train to compete. They show up, get dropped early, and spend 12 hours alone.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 8-12 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.

**Purchase includes:** 12-week structured training plan (84 workouts), complete training guide (18,000+ words), race-specific preparation protocols, lifetime access to all plan updates.

Train with purpose. Race with confidence.
