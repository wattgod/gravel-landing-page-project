# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan unlocks it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Race-specific power zones calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available. Technical skills curriculum covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling. Structured taper in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form. Progressive overload system with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly. Pacing strategy guide for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong.

**Your training guide delivers**: Race Tactics  — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong. Race Week Protocol  — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form. Training Fundamentals  — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed.
