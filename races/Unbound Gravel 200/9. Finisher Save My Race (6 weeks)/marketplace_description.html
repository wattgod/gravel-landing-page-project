# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

**42 structured workouts across 6 weeks.** Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure. Structured taper in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form. Race-specific power zones calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available. Pacing strategy guide for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong. Polarized training distribution that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles.
