# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

This plan wasn't built for people hoping to podium—it was built for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no 'close enough' on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you.

You've been your own coach long enough. You know self-coaching has blind spots. This plan removes them. The periodization is precise. The intensity distribution is optimized. The taper is calculated. Performance peaks when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Heat adaptation protocol (Weeks 6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains through systematic exposure. Polarized volume distribution with 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5—proven elite training principle. Altitude protocols for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section). Threshold blocks that build sustainable race pace without overtraining. Recovery metrics that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off.

**Your training guide delivers**: Fueling & Hydration — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace. Workout Execution — Recovery metrics that prevent overtraining while maximizing adaptation. Technical Skills — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter. Training Fundamentals — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5.

**The alternative?** Without a plan, 18+ hours of training can go either way: perfect preparation or systematic overtraining. The difference is structure you actually follow.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 18-25+ hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.

**Purchase includes:** 12-week structured training plan (84 workouts), complete training guide (18,000+ words), race-specific preparation protocols, lifetime access to all plan updates.

Train with purpose. Race with confidence.
