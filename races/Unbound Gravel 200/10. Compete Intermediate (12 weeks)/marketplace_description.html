# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

You're training 12-18 hours. You're doing the work. But something's not translating to race day. Usually it's one of three things: wrong intensity distribution, poor pacing strategy, or mismatched taper protocol. This plan addresses all three.

You're training 12-18 hours but results aren't translating. Most riders at this volume train too much in the middle—not hard enough, not easy enough. This plan uses polarized training: 80% easy, 20% hard. The structure is systematic. The progression is clear. Race fitness arrives when you need it.

**84 structured workouts across 12 weeks.** Periodized intensity with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering. G Spot work (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot. Mental training system for suffering management and tactical decision-making. VO2max intervals that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering. Precision taper protocol with deload timing proven for competitive athletes.

**Your training guide delivers**: Race-Specific Preparation — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices. Race Tactics — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing. Your 12-Week Arc — Progressive overload system with clear intensity targets. Training Fundamentals — Periodization principles that create predictable performance.

**The alternative?** You could hire a generic coach who gives you cookie-cutter workouts. They don't understand gravel. They don't understand your specific limiters. You pay for training you could've Googled.

**Real numbers:** 12 weeks, 84 workouts, 12-18 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
