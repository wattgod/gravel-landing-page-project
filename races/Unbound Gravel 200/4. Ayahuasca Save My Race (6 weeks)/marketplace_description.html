# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.

Most time-crunched riders try to cram high-volume training into low-volume weeks. It doesn't work. This plan uses high-intensity intervals and efficient structure to maximize adaptation from minimal time. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally.

**42 structured workouts across 6 weeks.** Taper protocol designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks. Fueling protocols tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress. High-efficiency workouts designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes. Skills-first approach that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race. Outdoor options for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution.

**Your training guide delivers**: Race Week Protocol  — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers. Technical Skills  — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals. FAQ  — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions. Fueling & Hydration  — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume.

**The alternative?** Without structured training, those 4 hours turn into riding around. No progression. No intensity. No race-specific prep. You arrive at Unbound with fitness you could've built on a commute.

**Real numbers:** 6 weeks, 42 workouts, 0-5 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
