<!-- OPENING PROMISE (TIER-SPECIFIC) -->
<div style="margin-bottom:20px">
<p style="margin:0;font-size:24px;font-weight:700;line-height:1.3">You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.</p>
</div>

<!-- STORY/JUSTIFICATION -->
<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5">I built this plan for people who are making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.</p>
</div>

<!-- WHAT THIS PLAN BUILDS -->
<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<h3 style="font-size:14px;text-transform:uppercase;border-bottom:1px solid #000;padding-bottom:5px;margin-bottom:8px">What This Plan Builds</h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:16px">Taper protocol designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks. Fueling protocols tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress. High-efficiency workouts designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes. Skills-first approach that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race. Outdoor options for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution.</p>

<!-- INCLUDED GUIDE -->

<h3 style="font-size:13px;text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0 8px;color:#555">Your Training Guide</h3>
<p style="margin:0 0 6px;font-size:14px"><strong>18,000+ Word Tactical Manual</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:14px;line-height:1.5">Race Week Protocol  — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers. Technical Skills  — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals. FAQ  — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions. Fueling & Hydration  — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume. Training Zones  — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required.</p>

<!-- THE ALTERNATIVE -->
<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<h3 style="font-size:14px;text-transform:uppercase;border-bottom:1px solid #000;padding-bottom:5px;margin-bottom:8px">The Alternative</h3>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">Without structured training, those 4 hours turn into riding around. No progression. No intensity. No race-specific prep. You arrive at Unbound with fitness you could've built on a commute.</p>

<!-- WHAT THIS ISN'T -->
<div style="margin-bottom:14px">
<p style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:16px">This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.</p>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:16px">If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.</p>
