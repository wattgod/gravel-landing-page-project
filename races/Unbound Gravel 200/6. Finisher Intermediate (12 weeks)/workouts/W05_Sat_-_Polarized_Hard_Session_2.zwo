  <name>W05 Sat - Polarized Hard Session #2</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE:
20 min warmup with openers → 7x4 min @ 110-115% FTP (4 min easy between) → 10 min cooldown

• Seven intervals—most yet. These hurt. Embrace it. VO2max work is uncomfortable but hugely effective. If you can't complete all seven at target power, that's okay. Quality matters more than quantity.

• CADENCE WORK: Alternate high and low cadence. Intervals 1, 3, 5, 7 at high cadence (100+ rpm seated); intervals 2, 4, 6 at low cadence (40-60 rpm seated, big gear).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT TRAINING (Good):
Protocol: Option 1: 20-40 min Z2 ride inside with reduced airflow. Option 2: 10-15 min sauna/hot bath immediately after training. Keep core temp elevated but manageable. Drink ~500-750 ml + 500-1000 mg sodium during exposure. Finish with only light cooling (no cold shower).

Effect: Start of measurable heat adaptation, raises plasma volume. Training stress increases slightly but manageable.

Use When: Medium weeks, early build phase, you want adaptation without deep fatigue.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
