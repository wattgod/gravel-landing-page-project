# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. Every session here has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting.

You're training 12-18 hours but results aren't translating. Most riders at this volume train too much in the middle—not hard enough, not easy enough. This plan uses polarized training: 80% easy, 20% hard. The structure is systematic. The progression is clear. Race fitness arrives when you need it.

**42 structured workouts across 6 weeks.** G Spot work (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot. 9-hour dress rehearsal validating everything from nutrition to power distribution at race intensity. VO2max intervals that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering. Mental training system for suffering management and tactical decision-making. Periodized intensity with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering.

**Your training guide delivers**: Workout Execution — How to nail VO2max, threshold, and G Spot (88-92% FTP) sessions. Race Tactics — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing. Your 12-Week Arc — Progressive overload system with clear intensity targets. Technical Skills — Advanced bike handling for aggressive racing on rough terrain.

**The alternative?** Most people at your volume plateau: same training, same results, year after year. They never break through because they never change the stimulus.

**Real numbers:** 6 weeks, 42 workouts, 12-18 hours per week. FTP-based zones with RPE guidance. 18,000+ word guide covering training, technical skills, race execution. $99.
