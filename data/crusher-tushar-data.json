      "founder": "Burke Swindlehurst",
      "origin_story": "Created by former pro cyclist Burke Swindlehurst as a mixed-surface race showcasing the Tushar Mountains. Known for its relentless climbing and stunning alpine scenery.",
      "notable_moments": [
        "Started as a 70-mile gravel/road hybrid before gravel racing exploded",
        "Featured on Lifetime Grand Prix circuit",
        "Known for its pro-level competition"
      ],
      "reputation": "The climber's gravel race. Where road fitness meets mountain bike descending."

    "course_description": {
      "character": "Relentless vertical. You climb for 35 miles, then descend for 35 miles. Simple math, brutal execution.",

        {"mile": 15, "label": "Col Summit Approach", "desc": "The climbing starts getting real. Thin air starts biting."},
        {"mile": 35, "label": "Eagle Point Summit", "desc": "11,500 feet. The highest point. You're either adapted or suffering."},
        {"mile": 50, "label": "Technical Descent", "desc": "Tired legs, loose gravel, 30 mph. Focus or crash."}
      ],
      "signature_challenge": "The altitude. 10,000+ feet average means your power is down 10-15%. Plan accordingly."

    "ratings_breakdown": {
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Not Unbound-famous, but deeply respected in the gravel community. Finishing Crusher means you can climb AND descend. The mixed-surface format and pro field give it serious credibility."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At 69 miles, it's not an ultra-endurance test. But 10,000+ feet of climbing compressed into that distance means time-on-course often exceeds 6-8 hours for most riders."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The descents are the differentiator. Loose gravel at speed, steep grades, and fatigue make this a real skill test. Poor descenders give back everything they gained on the climbs."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "10,000+ feet of vertical gain in 69 miles. That's 145 feet per mile average. The climbing is relentless and concentrated. If you can't climb, you can't Crusher."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "July in Utah at altitude is unpredictable. Morning can be 50°F, afternoon 80°F. Thunderstorms roll in fast. Sun exposure at elevation is brutal. Layer options matter."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Much of the race is above 9,000 feet, topping out at 11,500. If you live at sea level, you NEED altitude adaptation time. This isn't optional—it's survival."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The Tushar Mountains are remote and stunning. Alpine meadows, aspen groves, and 360-degree mountain views. This isn't just a race—it's an expedition through one of Utah's hidden gems."

    "biased_opinion": {
      "verdict": "Climber's Paradise",
      "summary": "Crusher is what happens when you take a mountain stage of the Tour and add gravel. It's not for everyone—flat-landers and non-climbers will suffer disproportionately. But if you love vertical and want to test yourself against thin air, this is your race.",
      "strengths": [
        "The scenery: Tushar Mountains are criminally underrated. World-class alpine beauty.",
        "The challenge: Pure climbing race with technical descents. Rewards complete cyclists.",
        "The field: Strong pro attendance brings legitimacy and race-day energy."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Altitude: If you can't acclimatize, you can't compete. Period.",
        "Logistics: Beaver, Utah isn't exactly a travel hub. Plan for a road trip.",
        "The climbing: 10,000 feet in 69 miles is relentless. Recovery from this takes time."
      ],
      "bottom_line": "If you're a climber looking for a gravel race that plays to your strengths, Crusher is your Super Bowl. If you're not—this will humble you."
    },
    
    "black_pill": {
      "title": "THE THING NOBODY TELLS YOU",
      "reality": "Altitude doesn't care about your FTP. You can be a 4.5 w/kg rider at sea level and feel like a 3.5 at 10,000 feet. If you can't arrive early and adapt, you'll watch climbers you normally drop ride away from you.",
      "consequences": [
        "Travel to Beaver, Utah takes effort. No direct flights. Budget for a road trip.",
        "Altitude adaptation requires 3-7 days minimum. That's vacation time or remote work.",
        "The descents will punish poor bike handling. Technical skills matter as much as fitness."
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "This isn't a gravel race you can 'just show up' to. The altitude and terrain demand specific preparation. A 12-week training plan with altitude simulation is table stakes for a respectable finish."

    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "88 / 100",
      "one_liner": "The climber's gravel race—where thin air separates pretenders from contenders.",
      "should_you_race": "If you love climbing and want a race that rewards it, absolutely. If you're a diesel-engine flat-lander, consider something else. The altitude alone makes this a specialist's race.",
      "alternatives": "If you want climbing without altitude: Leadville (higher but different format). If you want gravel without the vertical: SBT GRVL Green offers similar beauty with less suffering per mile."
