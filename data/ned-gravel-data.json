      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Not a bucket-list race nationally, but respected in Colorado gravel circles. The Ned Overend connection gives it heritage cred."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "At 55 miles, this is approachable. Not a full-day suffer-fest. Good for intermediate riders or as a shorter altitude test."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late August in Colorado is generally great. Morning chill, afternoon warmth. Thunderstorm risk exists but timing usually favors morning finish."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing at 8,000-11,000 feet matters. Sea-level riders need 2-4 days minimum acclimation. Altitude is a real factor here."

      "title": "THE THING NOBODY TELLS YOU",
      "reality": "Ned Gravel is low-key in the best way. Don't expect Unbound production value. Expect a well-organized race with a small-town vibe. That's the point.",
      "consequences": [
        "Nederland lodging is very limited. Book immediately or stay in Boulder (30 min drive).",
