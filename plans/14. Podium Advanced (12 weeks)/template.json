Weeks 5-8: maintain volume, add quality. Weeks 9-12: sharpen while preserving durability. Testing week—FTP Tuesday, durability assessment Saturday. You need 20-25 hours weekly. If you don't have that time, this isn't your plan.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation assessment week. Tuesday has FTP test + aerobic efficiency (45 min @ 65-70% FTP). Wednesday-Sunday are all easy endurance volume days (3-5 hours each). Saturday has durability assessment ride (5-6 hours). Sunday includes max strength work. This week establishes your baseline and introduces HVLI rhythm.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
