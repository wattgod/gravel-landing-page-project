GOAT is adaptive—it needs data to adapt TO. Establish monitoring protocols: HRV measured every morning (same conditions—upon waking, still in bed, 5-min reading). Track: sleep quality/duration, RPE from workouts, resting HR, subjective readiness (1-10 scale). Use TrainingPeaks or similar to track CTL/ATL/TSB. Week 1 creates the dashboard.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Comprehensive assessment week. Tuesday has FTP + critical power testing (power profile). Thursday has LT1 + durability assessment. Saturday is long pyramidal base ride (6-7 hours). Sunday includes max strength work. This week establishes your baseline and identifies primary limiters for Block 1.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
