Unlike true beginners, you already have base fitness—you've been riding consistently but need race-specific sharpening. G-Spot (87-92% FTP) and Threshold (95-105% FTP) are your weapons—they deliver maximum race readiness in minimum time. This isn't about building base—that takes months. This is about sharpening what you have. Week 1: assessment. Weeks 2-4: concentrated G-Spot/Threshold loading. Week 5: light recovery/sharpening. Week 6: taper/race.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Assessment week. Tuesday has FTP test + G-Spot sustainability check. Thursday has threshold assessment (race pace check). This week determines which track you follow in Weeks 2-4: Aggressive (strong performance), Balanced (moderate performance), or Foundation (weak performance). Be honest with yourself.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
