G-Spot (87-92% FTP) and Threshold (95-105% FTP) are your weapons\u2014they deliver maximum race readiness in minimum time. This isn't about building base\u2014that takes months. This is about sharpening what you have. Week 1: assessment. Weeks 2-4: concentrated G-Spot/Threshold loading (balanced approach). Week 5: light recovery/sharpening. Week 6: taper/race.\n\n\u2022 WEEK PREVIEW: Assessment week. Tuesday has FTP test + G-Spot sustainability check. Thursday has threshold assessment (race pace check). This week establishes your baseline. Weeks 2-4 use a balanced approach that hits all systems adequately\u2014no track selection needed.\n\n\u2022 REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
