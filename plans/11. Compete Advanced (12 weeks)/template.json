          "description": "• Welcome to advanced Block Periodization for podium contention. Unlike traditional periodization (building everything simultaneously), block periodization concentrates training stress on ONE system at a time in 2-4 week blocks. This creates deeper adaptation in each system sequentially. Week 1: comprehensive testing to identify YOUR primary limiter. Weeks 2-5: concentrated loading on biggest limiter (Block 1). Weeks 6-7: recovery/transmutation. Weeks 8-10: sharpening block (Block 2). Weeks 11-12: taper/race. This requires discipline—you'll temporarily neglect some capacities to overload others. Advanced athletes understand this trade-off delivers superior results.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Comprehensive assessment week. Tuesday has complete power profiling (FTP + 5-min + 3-min + 1-min efforts). Thursday has threshold endurance + repeatability test. Saturday has durability assessment ride (5-6 hours with sustained efforts). This week determines which block you follow in Weeks 2-5: VO2max, Threshold, Durability, or Neuromuscular.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
