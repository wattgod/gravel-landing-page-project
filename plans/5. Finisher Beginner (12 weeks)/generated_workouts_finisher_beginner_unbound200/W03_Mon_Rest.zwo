  <name>W03 Mon - Rest</name>
  <description>• This is your biggest week so far.
  • By Saturday you should feel accumulated fatigue—that's normal and expected.
  • Week 4 is a recovery week, so push through knowing rest is coming.
  • Every workout counts this week.
  • Sleep 8+ hours.
  • Eat enough.
  • Hydrate.
• WEEK PREVIEW:
  • Biggest week yet.
  • Tuesday introduces threshold intervals (hard but sustainable).
  • Thursday is your first VO2max work (this will hurt—embrace it).
  • Saturday is your longest ride with mixed intensity—simulates race-day efforts when tired.

• REST DAY NOTE:
  • Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.</description>
