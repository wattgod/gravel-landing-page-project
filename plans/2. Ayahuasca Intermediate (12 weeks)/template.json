This plan uses G-Spot (87-92% FTP) and Threshold (95-105% FTP) because they deliver maximum fitness gains in minimum time. Every minute counts. No junk miles. You'll do 2-3 quality sessions per week with everything else as rest or very light recovery. This is about FTP gains and race pace power—the most important metrics for gravel racing success.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test (20 min max sustained effort). Thursday introduces G-Spot intervals (3x10 min). Saturday is tempo endurance (75-90 min). This week establishes your baseline and introduces time-efficient intensity.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
