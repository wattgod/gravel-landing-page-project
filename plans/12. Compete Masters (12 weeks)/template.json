This plan combines autoregulation (adjusting to YOUR daily readiness) with polarized distribution (80% easy, 20% hard). Check HRV daily if possible—high/normal = green light for quality. Low = easy day or rest. No HRV? Use perceived recovery: good sleep + fresh legs = go. Poor sleep + heavy legs = back off. Masters principle: recovery enables performance. You can't force fitness at 50+.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test + durability assessment (if HRV green). Thursday introduces first hard session (VO2max—if HRV green). Saturday is first long easy ride (2.5-3.5 hours). Sunday includes strength work—critical for 50+ athletes. Track HRV daily to establish baseline.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
